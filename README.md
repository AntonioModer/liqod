**What It Does**
* Simulates water based on the SPH concept.    

**What It Doesn't Do**
* Creates drinkable water.

**Demo**

By compiling the main.lua code use the left button to spawn particles and the escape key to close. 
The demo also works on mobile and it supports multitouch but it's kinda slow.
