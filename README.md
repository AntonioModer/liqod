Water Simulation for LÖVE that uses SPH approach to simulate water like physics, it's purely writen in Lua and it's a work in progress.
All help is appreciated :)

**What It Does**
* Simulates water based on the SPH concept.    

**What It Doesn't Do**
* Creates drinkable water. 

***

**Demo**

By compiling the main.lua code use:
* Left button to spawn particles
* "b" key to change between boundaries
* "g" key to change gravity
* "w" key to change the type of gravity/water
* Escape key to close

The demo also works on mobile and it supports multitouch but it's kinda slow:
* Screen press to spawn particles
* Bottom left screen press to change between boundaries
* Bottom right screen press to change gravity
* Upper left screen press to change the type of gravity/water
